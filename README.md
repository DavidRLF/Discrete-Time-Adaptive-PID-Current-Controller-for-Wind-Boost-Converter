# Discrete-Time-Adaptive-PID-Current-Controller-for-Wind-Boost-Converter
This repository presents the simulation file used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Discrete-Time Adaptive PID Current Controller for a Wind Boost Converter.

The following figure shows the block diagram of the small-scale wind turbine system circuit implementation based on the PIL simulation approach, which requires the Wind_Perfil variable to be executed and the embedded F28M3x concerto system connected to the COM6 serial port computer.
